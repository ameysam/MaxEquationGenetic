# Genetic Algorithm example

### Target: Maximize this equation
Y = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4 + w5x5 + w6x6

### Idea
For maximize this equation, the positive input is to be multiplied by the largest possible positive number and the negative number is to be multiplied by the smallest possible negative number.
